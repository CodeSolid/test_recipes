# JavaScript Testing Recipes

This project is a collection of recipes for testing on JavaScript.  Each directory 
will contain a recipe, often as an NPM package, along with documentation.  Depending 
on community feedback, we may break some of those out into git submodules. See [Additional Research Needed](docs/research_needed.md).

## What's here
It's in the early stages, with recipes covering [Ava](ava_getting_started/README.md),  [Mocha](mocha_expect_typescript/README.md), and [Jest](jest_basic/README.md).

## Over time ...

More will be revealed.
