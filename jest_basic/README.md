# Jest Basic

This test sets up a really basic Jest build with examples, based on the [Jest Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/getting-started.html) Guide.
This was incredibly easy to set up using Jest defaults.

We test some trivial math functions and our greeter defaults to "Hello, World!" of course.

## Usage

```bash
npm install 
npm test
```
