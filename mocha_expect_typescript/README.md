# Sample Mocha Tests with Expect Using TypeScript

## Do this first

Before you run this project, you'll need to install TypeScript 2.x globally.  Tested with:

npm install -g typescript@2.0.3

(If anyone knows a way to get TypeScript 2.x running inside npm, please drop a note or submit a pull request).

## What's here

This project shows you how to set up a trivially simple test build to use Mocha with the Expect assertion library, in which your tests are written in TypeScript.
