# JavaScript Testing Recipes

This project is a collection of recipes for testing on JavaScript.  Each directory 
will contain a recipe, often as an NPM package, along with documentation.  Depending 
on community feedback, we may break some of those out into git submodules. See [Additional Research Needed](docs/research_needed.md).

## What's here
It's in the early stages, with the beginnings of two recipes about ava and mocha.

## Over time ...

We hope to cover a variety of topics related to these frameworks: 

* Ava 
* Jasmine
* Karma
* Mocha (with various assertion libraries, test styles, Sinon, etc.)
* QUnit

Some of the topics and themes we'll be exploring include:

* Using a given framework with ES6 (built-in with Ava!)
* Using a given framework with TypeScript.
* Universal tests (configurations to run tests on node or in Browser)
* Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end testing with Selenium.
* Techniques for doing Asynchrounous / Synchronous testing
* Testing
* A core sample set of "Objects Under Test" -- basically a library of things that work / things that break that we can apply our tests to.


Of course when you multiply those two facile, "just add code" lists by each other, that's a lot to do already, something like 40 demos. We'll obviously have to pick our battles, go at it incrementally, and welcome contributors, speaking of which:

At this point since we haven't gotten the ball rolling significantly by checking in our first complete recipes, so asking for a pull request would be presumptuous.  However, feel free to add wishlist items to [Issue #1](https://github.com/CodeSolid/test_recipes/issues/1).
