# Research Needed

Figure out how to best structure repository.  One way is npm pointing to a branch, but the downside of that is that
there won't (?  how about master ?) be a single comprehensive "thing to download to get everything".

Use cases / Requirements are:

	* I'm John, and I want to work in development for awhile without worrying about all of this.
	* I'm a contributor, and I want to be able to have a starter branch / directory I can rename and pull to create 
	an independent branch.
	* I'm a contributor, and I want to do a pull request with a fork of the project, by simply adding a folder
	underneath root.
	* I'm looking at the product on github and I want to download the whole shooting match.
	* I want to install just ONE of the recipies, without downloading the whole project, using NPM.
	* I want to install all the recipies using NPM
